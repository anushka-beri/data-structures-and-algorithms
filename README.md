# DSA Notes with code examples in JavaScript
DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms. It's a fundamental concept in computer science and software engineering.

Data structures refer to the way data is organized and stored in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc. Each data structure has its own advantages and is suitable for specific types of operations.

Algorithms, on the other hand, are step-by-step procedures or methods for solving problems, particularly those that involve computation. Algorithms are designed to manipulate data structures in order to perform tasks such as searching, sorting, inserting, deleting, or modifying data.

DSA is crucial for writing efficient and optimized computer programs. By understanding data structures and algorithms, developers can write code that performs well in terms of speed and memory usage, even for large-scale applications. It's an essential part of software development, particularly in fields like computer science, software engineering, and data science.
